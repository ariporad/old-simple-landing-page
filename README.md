# My Website

This is a super simple website that I threw together to serve as a landing page for me. In February of 2021, I replaced it with a much more in-depth landing page and portfolio ([ariporad/ariporad.github.io](https://github.com/ariporad.github.io)).

## Hosting

This website was hosted on Github pages as [ariporad.github.io](https://ariporad.github.io).

[ariporad.com](https://ariporad.com) points to that website through Cloudflare (which adds SSL via LetsEncrypt). Github pages sees it as a standard custom domain.
